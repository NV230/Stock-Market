# Stock-Market

Our project focuses on Data Analysis using Python.
We chose to focus on an area of study that we all have a passion for finance.
More specifically, we looked at how we could integrate stock analysis with Python.
For our project, we created three unique market-related programs
The first program we created was a simple stock comparison program:
First, this program prompts the user to input the number of companies they would like to look at.
Second, it asks the user to input the ticker symbol for the company they want.  
Once the ticker is inputted, the system displays the share price from the past five days along with the share prices from the first five days that the company (IPOs)
The second step is repeated for the number of times that the user inputted into the first step.
The second program we created was a cumulative return pyplot:
Cumulative return is basically the change of a stock price through a certain period of time.
So from its IPO (initial public offering), our model shows the percentage it has increased from its original price.
It also compares two other companies to give a better picture and see which companies have boomed.
The third program we created was a stock price email sender:
This program allows the user to enter a certain price that they want to see their company surpass.
Once they type the ticker for the company, the program looks to see if the company has passed that price and if so, sends an email to the user letting them know that it works.
Our three programs were centered around the Yahoo Finance library.
